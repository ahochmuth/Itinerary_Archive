# Teamwork Questionnaire for Andre Hochmuth

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
      Reach me by calling me, texting me, or by email. These are listed in order of effectiveness. I prefer texting over email. Anytime I am not in class or at work is a good time. Evening hours are the best to contact me.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
      I expect to be a high performing team in the class that all get A's or B's. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
      My goal is to first find the most effective role I can play to service my team. Then excel in this role in order to help my team perform well.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
      Laziness, Poor communication, and High Workloads will be the only thing getting in the way of team performance as well as personal performance. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
      That is fine in this class due to the grading structure. I have never had a problem with working harder than others to achieve an A. Even in group projects, I have always put in the extra work to get an A if my teammates do not reciprocate work ethic.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
      It depends on the context. But for the most part yes, if some people work harder to get an A, then it shows and they should receive a higher grade.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
      8 including lectures. so 5 hours outside of class every week + variability depending on the week. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
      Team discussions and project planning. Though we will decide specifically based on what prior knowledge skills people have. Personal enthusiasm for certain parts of the project will also be nice, since a programmer who is excited to program is much better than one who does not like what they are coding.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
      First the team will communicate with the 'missing' person using all forms of communication. Then if there is no response for a long period of time, the teacher will immediately be contacted to discuss alternatives.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
      The team can discuss and compromise a solution. This is a basic skill and common issue in the workplace.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
      We will find strengths/weaknesses and plan according to the strengths of people.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
      We will be meeeting on Mondays and Wednesdays after class to work on assignments/projects, since we all have already discussed this topic.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
      Well since we are meeting on Mondays and Wednesdays, we can probably add Saturdays whenever necessary to work on projects. And other times should also be considered.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
      Yes, we will need to stay in contact with everybody for big decisions using Slack or phone. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
      We will burn the non-follower alive, 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
      If it makes people feel uncomfortable, then the team needs to either deal with the situation or ask a TA to act as a liason to negotiate with the person who is dominating. Otherwise it is completely normal to have a facilitator. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
      Just communicate with everybody that you feel that way. It's a simple yet vital skill to be able to communicate problems like this to the team.
