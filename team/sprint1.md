# Sprint 1 - t12 - *Smells Like Team Spirit*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *Mike Popesh*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (team/sprint#.md).

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* Someone else approves and merges commits, you may not merge your own changes.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#17 The application should identify the client and server currently in use*
* *#18 Use a standard logging system on the server*
* *#16 I'd like the know who to thank for this tool*
* *#20 I want to compute the distance between two locations on the planet*
* *#29 I want to know where I am on the map*
* *#15 I may need distances in other units of measure*


## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *#17 The application should identify the client and server currently in use*: simple text changes, took very little time
* *#18 Use a standard logging system on the server*: little done with logging in sprint1, added toString methods to classes
* *#16 I'd like the know who to thank for this tool*: added text and images to About page, minimal editing required

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *#20 I want to compute the distance between two locations on the planet*: ran out of time to handle invalid/formatted coordinate values
* *#29 I want to know where I am on the map*: no time to start implementing this epic, could be time intensive
* *#15 I may need distances in other units of measure*: no time to start implementing this epic, also looks time intensive

#### What went well
* Team adapated to git quickly
* Implemented haversine function quickly (and cited it). This allowed for ample testing time
* Team member Nick ODell created a script to make deploying very easy and a no push to master script

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *Introduction of new software*: Teammates helped each other and spent time reading documentation
* *Misunderstanding of epic goals*: Team sought clarification from group/piazza/TAs
* *Lack of understanding of how the provided code worked*: Team spent time studying and tweeking code

## Retrospective

#### What went well
	The team worked well as a group. Everyone was honest about what they could or couldnt do. Followed git and zenhub protocols.

#### Potential improvements
	The team needs to have a better understanding of ReactJS, git, and Intellij so we can work more efficiently. Time is a constraint on the team this semester so spending time on the project effectively is important

#### What we will change next time
	Next sprint the team will spend more time in the planning process, especially on our tasks creation.
