# Sprint 4 - *T12* - *Team Spirit*

## Goal

### Worldwide!
### Sprint Leader: *Simon Nardos*

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>4.0.0</version>` for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release `v4.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Increment `server-3.5.jar` deployed for testing and demonstration on CHECK4 assignment.
* Increment `server-4.0.jar` deployed for testing and demonstration on SPRINT4 assignment.
* Sprint Review, Restrospective, and Metrics completed (team/sprint4.md).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop (in that order).
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent interface (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).
* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 50%
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.

* #150 Data Shouldnt go away when I change tabs
* #149 Let me Change my itinerary
* #79 Calculator data doesnt go away when units change
* #237 Let me plan trips worldwide: choosing which markers to display
* #238 I would like to highlight certain places on the map

***The start of this sprint will focus on completing all necessary epics from sprint 3. Therefore epics 150,149, and 79 will be top priority for our team. We then decided to add epic 237 and 238 due to Professor Matthews emphasizing their importance in class on Monday. Depending on how busy everyone is in other classes we may be able to sneak in another epic and complete it but again the five we have selected are of utmost importance and we plan on completely these to the absolute best of our abilities.***

## Review (focus on solution and technology)

In this sprint, our API tested very well during the check and we believe that is due to our intergration tester that we made, 

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 

These Epics were completed.

* *238 Highlight Markers: useful information on markers*
* *79 Calculater Data: Calculater Data doesnt go away when switch tabs*
* *150 Data Go Away: Data doesnt go away when switch tabs*
* *149 Change Itinerary: Allow user to change itinerary*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 

These Epics were not completed.

* *237 Let me plan trips world wide: Continents not factored into our code at the moment but everything else is*
*

#### What went well

The plan went well we had issues for all the changes in tip which led to the API testing going well, due to API testing going so well the check went well because we scored high on it. 


#### Problems encountered and resolutions

The problem we encountered was application becoming more complicated due to the development of our project, we resolved these problems with minor changes to our application. The complexity of nearest neighbor was a problem and being able to break it down was a resolution.


## Retrospective (focus on people, process, tools)

In this sprint, we had class canceled so in order overcome this we had scrum over slack. 

#### What we changed this sprint

Our changes for this sprint included not meeting up as much, which we plan on changing again to meeting up more.

#### What we did well

We did a good job on the burndown chart, we did well on inspections and it inpsired more inspections on other code.

#### What we need to work on

We could improve in our time spent together working especially compared to our other sprints

#### What we will change next sprint 

We will change how much time we spend working together to get back to old habits and stregthen our togetherness.
