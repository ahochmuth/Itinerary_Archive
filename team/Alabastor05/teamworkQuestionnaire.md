# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Mike Popesh_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__
   * The best way to reach me in a timely fashion throughout the day is by text. I will also check my email and slack regularly during the day (6:00AM-8:00PM).  
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__
   * My expectations are that every team member tries their best and doesn't give up on any of the assignments.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__
   * My personal goals for this semester are to get comfortable coding in a team environment and asking for help when I'm struggling. I waste time in confusion when I could solve the problem quickly by asking for assistance.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__
   * The biggest obstacles I foresee will be procrastination and heavy workloads from other classes for all the team members.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__
   * The grade calculations for this course will allow those that put in extra effort to be rewarded.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__
   * It is acceptable for team members to do more work on an assignment as long as it is in the teams best interests and not just their own.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__
   * If each group member contributes 8-10 focused hours on the project each week I would expect we will be successful on the project.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__
   * The group will have to construct a development plan for the project where assignments are distributed by necessity, skill, and/or preference.  
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__
   * Each group member is aware that the grade they receive is partly based on how their group perceives their performance. A failure to meet a commitment will be communicated to the member and a grade penalty should be expected.  
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__
   * Each group member will have different opinions on quality and should expect to have disagreements with their group members throughout the semester. The disagreements should be handled respectfully with the understanding that compromising is important aspect of any team process.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__
   * Having different work habits in a group is expected. We should try and design our workflow around these habits to take advantage of the time we have.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__
   * We have decided to work as a group after class during the week. I am comfortable adjusting meeting times if necessary but would prefer to have set meeting times outside of class each week.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__
   * I think the team should have 2-3 set meetings involving all the members each week. Coordinating time in the lab with members will also be important outside of scheduled meetings.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__
   * All team members should be consulted before making any decision that will affect the group. Each member should make and effort to be reachable throughout this semester and warn the group if they will not be.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__
   * If a compromise cannot be reached then the majority rule will have to stand. Each member should have an understanding that making timely decision will be important in this development process. These are group projects and the groups best interests should take priority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__
   * Having a member take a leadership role is perfectly acceptable, however, if a member is creating an uncomfortable environment the group needs to respectfully address the problem or ask management to intervene.  
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__
   * Communicate to the group my thoughts. We are going to live or die as group this semester and should support each other.
