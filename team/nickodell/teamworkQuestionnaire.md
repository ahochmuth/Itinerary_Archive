# Teamwork Questionnaire for _nickodell_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * In order of effectiveness: text, slack, or email. Contact me early morning, while I still have energy.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think we'll develop some software and learn some skills, and my expectations aren't much deeper than that.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I hope to get better at working with and interacting with a team in a professional context.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Managing personality conflicts will be important. Making sure that people do an equal share of work will be important.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I'm a very competitive person. I want to be the very best, like no-one ever was. I wouldn't be happy with that.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Yes, a project thrives on individual initiative.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Probably about 6 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We'll try to assign tasks in a fair way, so that people have a roughly equal share of work. Also, we'll try to assign tasks by interest level, so that someone who wants to try something can do so. Lastly, we want to cross-train people, so there isn't a section of the code that only one person understands.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Our first goal is to bring them into the process by contacting them and asking them to finish whatever they were working on. We can contact them via slack, email, or in person. If that reminder doesn't work, and they won't contribute, we can escalate to a teaching assistant or instructor.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If there's time remaining, other team-members can improve the quality of the work. However, the worst work will be done right before the deadline, so this is of limited help.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Judge by results, not process. If a teammate's process works, it's right for them.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, we will meet Monday/Wednesday/Friday after class, but one member can't attend on Friday.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 2-3 times a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * No, unless it's an important decision.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We might be able to come to a consensus through discussion, but that's not always possible. Inaction is a decision all it's own, and sometimes making the wrong decision is better than taking no action.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Is that person is making the rest of the team feel valued and taking input from each of them? If not, then that person needs to take a reduced role in the process, and let others make decisions. Not everything will be perfect, but everything will be arrived at by the team.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Complain about it to the rest of the group.
